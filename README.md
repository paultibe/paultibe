## Hi! I'm Paul:) 
Through my dual degree in computer science and behavioural neuroscience, I've had the unique privilege of peeking under two beautiful, complex, enormously relevant, and rapidly changing fields. I'm particularly interested in distributed systems, cloud computing, learning, personal knowledge management, and the intersection of AI, psychology, and neuroscience.

For some of my work, check out my [experience](https://paultiberghien.com/Experience) and [projects](https://paultiberghien.com/Projects).

To get to know me better, including my core beliefs, values, systems, and goals, checkout my [digital garden](https://garden.paultiberghien.com/).
